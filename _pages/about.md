I am a researcher and lecturer at [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/).

I hold a Ph.D. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) under [Prof. Eli Tilevich](https://people.cs.vt.edu/tilevich/).  

Research Interests
---
I am working at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Security & Privacy**, using innovative ideas and techniques in *program analysis*, *programming languages*, *trusted execution environment*, and *machine learning* to solve software engineering and security/privacy problems.
- **Software Engineering & Programming Languages:** program comprehension; code refactoring (compiler-based solution)
- **Trusted & Mobile Computing:** trusted execution environment (e.g., SGX, OP-TEE, Trusty); serverless framework
- **Security & Privacy:** vulnerabilities in mobile systems; differential privacy; critical program information protection
