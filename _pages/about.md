I am a researcher and lecturer at [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/).

I hold a Ph.D. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) under [Prof. Eli Tilevich](https://people.cs.vt.edu/tilevich/).  

Research Interests
---
My primary research focus is on **Software Engineering**, with additional interests in **Trusted & Mobile Computing** and **Software Security & Privacy**.
I use innovative ideas and techniques in *programming languages*, *program analysis*, *trusted execution environment*, and *machine learning* to solve software engineering and security/privacy problems.
- **Software Engineering:** software testing; program comprehension; code refactoring (compiler-based solution)
- **Trusted & Mobile Computing:** trusted execution environment-based software; Android system/framework/app
- **Security & Privacy:** vulnerability detection in mobile apps/systems; privacy-preserving techniques; critical program information protection
