I am a researcher and lecturer at [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/).

I hold a Ph.D. in [Computer Science from Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) under [Prof. Eli Tilevich](https://people.cs.vt.edu/tilevich/).  

I am using novel ideas and techniques in programming languages, program analysis, and middleware to solve software engineering, mobile, and security problems.

*I am actively looking for motivated MS, undergraduate students to work with me. If you are interested in my research and/or have questions, please feel free to drop me an email (yinliu [AT] bjut [DOT] edu [DOT] cn) attached with your CV.*
