## Hobbies
I love Literature as much as Computer Science, especially, Chinese Classical Literature. 
I'm a big fan of Classical Chinese poetry, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms (one of the four great classical novels of Chinese Literature). 
Besides, I always enjoy reading Lu Xun, Milan Kundera, Franz Kafka, and Haruki Murakami.

### One of my Poems
长畏荆棘满路，安能笑傲江湖。一书一剑展雄图，燕然一鞭直度。

虽千万人吾往，董道不负心初。浩气不与世沉浮，枕戈静待箫鼓。
